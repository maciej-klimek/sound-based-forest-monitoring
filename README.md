# Intelligent Forest â€“ Illegal Logging Detection System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for detecting illegal logging activities using low-cost, energy-efficient acoustic sensors mounted on trees. The system captures distinctive sounds of chainsaws and heavy machinery, sends audio metrics and samples to a central platform, and visualizes detected threats on a heatmap with real-time alerts.

Our solution leverages signal processing, IoT, and artificial intelligence to classify sound events and estimate their location. The system is designed to be scalable, affordable, and easy to deploy in forested or remote areas. Potential applications also include military surveillance and environmental monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Acoustic Event Detection**: Identifies sounds related to illegal logging (e.g., chainsaws).
- **Wireless Data Transmission**: Sends audio metrics and samples to the cloud or local server.
- **AI-Based Classification**: Uses machine learning to distinguish between different sound sources.
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Displays alerts and sound intensity.
- **Low-Power IoT Design**: Optimized for long-term deployment in remote environments.

## Technologies Used

- Embedded IoT devices with microphones
- Audio signal processing
- Machine learning / sound classification
- AWS integration
- Web-based dashboard for visualization and alerting

## Goals

- Build a working prototype of the detection system  
- Test in simulated and real outdoor environments  
- Evaluate classification accuracy and energy efficiency  
- Prepare documentation and deployment guidelines
